# Quantyc Protocol Whitepaper

## Abstract

Quantyc Protocol is a decentralized platform for intelligent cloud management, powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It combines blockchain-based governance with tokenized resource access, allowing autonomous coordination of cloud services through smart contracts.

## Vision

To build a self-managing cloud ecosystem governed by token holders, where infrastructure adapts in real-time based on contextual needs and decentralized decision-making.

## Key Components

### 🪙 QNTC Token
The native ERC-20 token of the Quantyc Protocol. It is used for:
- Governance voting
- Accessing premium cloud features
- Staking for influence and rewards

### 🗳️ Governance Layer
Smart contracts allow QNTC holders to propose and vote on:
- System upgrades
- Resource allocations
- Policy changes

### 🧠 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
A logic layer that evaluates contextual data to manage cloud resources, adapting to:
- Demand fluctuations
- Pricing changes
- Usage trends

## Architecture Overview

1. Users hold QNTC tokens
2. Token holders propose and vote on governance matters
3. MCP reacts to real-time context for automation
4. Smart contracts execute decisions on-chain

## Use Cases

- Autonomous DevOps environments
- Community-run cloud infrastructure
- Pay-as-you-use decentralized hosting
- Decentralized AI/ML job routing

## Tokenomics

- **Token Symbol**: QNTC  
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 QNTC

| Allocation     | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Ecosystem      | 12%        |
| Team           | 6%         |
| Treasury       | 6%         |
| Public Supply  | 76%        |
